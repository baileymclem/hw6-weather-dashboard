# Weather Dashboard

 Using a third-party app, I created a weather dashboard that will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS.

## User Story

```
AS A traveler
I WANT to see the weather outlook for multiple cities
SO THAT I can plan a trip accordingly
```

For this project I relied heavily on Bootstrap for most of the styling. I created a basic HTML document and used Javascript to change and update the document. For the API data, I used two different ajax calls--one for the current weather and one for the five-day forecast. I used moment for the current date.
